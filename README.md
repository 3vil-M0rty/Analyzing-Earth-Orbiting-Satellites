# Analyzing Earth Orbiting Satellites

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing data related to Earth's orbiting satellites using UCS USA satellite data. It aims to gain insights into the characteristics of these satellites, including their orbits, classifications, and other parameters. The project comprises data extraction, transformation, loading (ETL), data exploration, and a website for tracking the satellites.

## Repository Contents
